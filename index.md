# About Me
(Portfolio still working progress)

# Robotics & Autonomous MSc Lincoln
## Dissertation Project (On Going, Finished by mid September)
Title: One-Class Classification for Anomaly Detection in Strawberries using Adversarially sythesised data <br/>
Motivation:
- Supervised learning approaches require large annoated datasets for classifying images 
- Anomalies are rare and datasets may not be available, expensive and timely to collect 
- Supervised learning is not true anomality detection, it can only detect instances of abnormality <br/>
Proposition:
- One-Class Classification is a technique to overcome some of these issues,
- in One-class (OC), the models are trained only using normal data (i.e. not anomalous)
- When anomalous data is presented to a system using OC it is able to discern it from normality 
- Another approach to learn normality is to use Generative Adversarial Networks (where the generator is an autoencoder)

Advanced Machine Learning 
- Tensorflow, Keras, Google Colab
- Image preparation (resizing, annotating and creating reproducable data splits) 
- Transfer Learning & Custom CNN Models for Image Classification 

Advanced Robotics 
- Netlogo Simulation of heterogeneous robotic solution for Apple Harvesting 
- One agent for harvesting apples, the other for collecting the apples 
- Investigated different task and agent allocation methods to see how this effected the difference between the maxiumum and minimum travelled distance for the collector robotic agents 
- Paper review of 12 different papers related to Grasping within the context of robotic fuit & veg harvesting

# Games Development BSc (1st)
## Dissertation Project
Title: Incentivise Recycling through the application of Gamification
- Android App made using Andriod Studio with Java,
- Fragments, Recycler views and 
- Firestore for storing recycled items for each user, Firebase Authentication for users account 

## Year 1 
Space Invaders style game, using Unity with C#
{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.year1Game %} <br/>

## Year 2
Games Jam (48 hours) Unity C#, worked alongside an artist and 2 other programmers
{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.year2Gamesjam %} <br/>

Software Enterprise Project - created a virtual experience of Tombola's new building in Sunderland for prospective employees. 
Tombola was the client, our team won the best group for that client where I was the team leader and created the building in 
Unity

## Year 3
Portfolio Game <br/>
- Age of War style game, player faces off against an enemy AI
- Recruit units to fight enemy, where the player to destroy the enemy base is the winner 
- Resource Management, funds slowely build up, units and upgrade have to be managed based upon the enemies strategy
- Animations using Unity Animator 
- Polished Game
