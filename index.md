# About Me


# Robotics & Autonomous MSc Lincoln


## Dissertation Project 
Title: One-Class Classification for Anomaly Detection in Strawberries using Adversarially sythesised data <br/>
Motivation:
- Supervised learning approaches require large annoated datasets for classifying images 
- Anomalies are rare and datasets may not be available, expensive and timely to collect 
- Supervised learning is not true anomality detection, it can only detect instances of abnormality
<br/>
Proposition:
- One-Class Classification is a technique to overcome some of these issues,
- in One-class (OC), the models are trained only using normal data (i.e. not anomalous)
- When anomalous data is presented to a system using OC it is able to discern it from normality 
- Another approach to learn normality is to use Generative Adversarial Networks (where the generator is an autoencoder)
