# About Me


# Robotics & Autonomous MSc Lincoln (ongoing)

## Dissertation Project 
Title: One-Class Classification for Anomaly Detection in Strawberries using Adversarially sythesised data
- Motivation:
- 
- Supervised learning approaches require large annoated datasets for classifying images 
- Anomalies are rare and datasets may not be available, expensive and timely to collect 
- Supervised learning is not true anomality detection, it can only detect instances of abnormality
- Proposition:
- One-Class Classification is a technique to overcome some of these issues,
- in One-class, the models are trained only using normal data (i.e. not anomalous)
